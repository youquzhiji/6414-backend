Using community-based distributed computing of untrusted nodes to accelerate ML computation, inspired by Folding@Home.

## Introduction

Existing distributed computing solutions using the map-reduce technique such as Hadoop requires a cluster of trusted nodes connected with high-speed local-area internet. However, without enough funding, creating an expensive cluster to scale up the computation wouldn't be viable.

However, a useful project can have a very large community. Even though very few people in the community are willing to donate funds to the project, many of them have capable computers that are resting most of the time. We predict that a lot more people are willing to contribute by donating their resting computational resources since a donation like this will have minimal cost to them.

This project aims to create a distributed cluster utilizing resting computational resources of willing contributors in the community. Our final goal is to create a program that anyone can run on their personal computers to turn their computer into a node in the cluster.
